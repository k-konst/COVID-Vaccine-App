    "## Biological Background\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, quickly spread across the globe following the first known case in Wuhan, China on November 17, 2019 \\[1\\]. The first case in the US was reported in Washington state on January 21, 2020, the same day the virus was confirmed to transmit person-to-person. Despite travel restrictions and quarantines around the world, the epidemic continued to spread, and the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 \\[2\\]. By December 18, 2020, there were 17,459,296 cumulative cases and 313,588 deaths in the US alone \\[3\\].<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The time from infection by SARS-CoV-2 and onset of symptoms is called the incubation period, and cases are asymptomatic during this period. It is estimated that the incubation period for COVID-19 is 4-5 days \\[4\\]. Once this period is over, a symptomatic case of COVID-19 displays symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste and smell \\[4\\]. In general, symptomatic cases of a disease are more infectious than asymptomatic cases, since symptoms like a cough allow for more of the virus to be spread through droplet and airborne transmission. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A COVID-19 vaccine has largely been seen as a sort of holy grail for ending the pandemic. Traditionally, a vaccine contains a dead or weakened strain of the virus. The injection of this strain through vaccination stimulates the bodyâ€™s adaptive immune system to develop antibodies against the virus, which will then help prevent future illness. However, messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines have been developed for SARS-CoV-2. The mRNA in the vaccine codes for a protein on the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The ribosomes in our cells transcribe the mRNA to make the protein. Then the protein is broken down and the pieces are displayed on our cells' surfaces, triggering an immune response \\[5\\]. Regardless of the type of vaccine, the end goal is the same: to generate the antibodies needed to combat infection should exposure to the real virus occur.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This app primarily serves as an educational tool and aims to develop a vaccination model for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. You'll investigate three epidemiological compartmental models of increasing complexity, run pandemic simulations, and see what happens when different variables are changed. Then you'll use these models along with real US COVID-19 pandemic data to answer some questions about a US vaccine strategy. <br>"

    "## The Mathematical Representation\n",
    "The models in this app are in the form of compartmental network models and based off the paper [\"An SVEIR model for assessing potential impact of an imperfect anti-SARS vaccine\"](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41823768_An_SVEIR_model_for_assessing_potential_impact_of_an_imperfect_anti-SARS_vaccine) by Gumel, McCluskey, and Watmough, which models the introduction of a SARS vaccine with less than 100% efficacy \\[6\\].  \n",
    "### What is a Compartmental Model?\n",
    "A compartmental model divides the total population under study into various categories and models the movement of individuals between categories using differential questions. The rate of transition between categories is often dependent on a rate constant and the size of one or both categories involved in the transition. For example, if we wanted to model the infection of currently uninfected, but susceptible individuals, we may write<br><br>\n",
    "$\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\beta SI$<br><br>\n",
    "$\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\beta SI$<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is the contact rate between susceptible and infected individuals (often described as the number of personal encounters per day multiplied by the probability of infection), S is the number of susceptible individuals, and I is the number of infected individuals. The inclusion of both the susceptible and individual populations in this transition is logical. The more susceptible individuals there are, the more opportunities for infection. The more infected individuals there are, the more the infection can spread. We can also model this transition through an arrow diagram, with the rate of transformation $\\beta SI$ written above the arrow: <br>\n",
    "<img src=\"SI_transition.png\"><br>\n",
    "It's important to note that these models assume parameters like $\\beta$ are constant with time. In reality, if a stay-at-home order were put in place or a mask-wearing mandate were implemented, these policies would decrerase the number of encounters a person would have per day and the probability of infection. Either or both of these effects would in turn decrease $\\beta$. "

    "### The Basic Reproduction Number ($R_0$)\n",
    "One more important concept we'll be using in this app is the basic reproduction number, or $R_0$ value. $R_0$ is the number of individuals each infected person will infect during the duration of illness. The greater $R_0$ is, the more the disease spreads. In its most basic form, $R_0$ can be calculated as <br>\n",
    "$R_0 = \\frac{\\beta}{\\mu}$ <br>\n",
    "where $\\beta$ is once again the contact rate and $\\mu$ is the recovery rate, equal to the inverse of the illness duration. As more modes of infection and removal from the susceptible population are introduced, the expression for calculated $R_0$ can become increasingly complicated. Generally speaking, an outbreak will occur if $R_0$ is greater than 1."

    "## Introducing a Vaccine: The SVIRD Model\n",
    "Let's start with the most basic epidemiological model including a vaccine: the SVIRD model. The SVIRD model contains the following categories: Susceptible (S), Vaccinated (V), Infected (I), Recovered (R), and Dead (D). The Dead category only includes deaths from the illness under study. Susceptible individuals can either become vaccinated or infected. Vaccinated individuals can also become infected, but at a decreased rate dependent on the vaccine efficacy. Infected individuals can either recover from the illness or die from it. For every day in the simulation, there are a number of births into the Susceptible population and deaths from other causes unrelated to the illness under study (natural mortality). The arrow diagram and differential equations for this model are below:<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"SVIRD_arrow.png\"><br>\n",
    "<img src = \"SVIRD_eqn.png\">\n",
    "where $\\Pi$ is the number of births per day, $\\mu$ is the natural mortality rate (proportion of the population per day that dies of non-illness causes), $\\beta$ is the contact rate (here defined as the probability of infection following exposure to SARS-CoV-2, multiplied by the number of encounters with others per day, and normalized by the total population $S_0$), $\\xi$ is the vaccination coverage rate (proportion of the susceptible population that is vaccinated per day), $\\tau$ is the vaccine efficacy, $\\delta$ is the recovery rate (inverse of the duration of illness), and $d$ is the illness death rate (proportion of infected individuals that die from the illness per day).<br><br>\n",
    "There are a few key assumptions in this model. First, recovered individuals are assumed to be immune and cannot become reinfected. Second, we assume that the vaccine does not expire, so there is no need for re-vaccination. Finally, there is the assumption that births and deaths are the only major contributors to total population change, as immigration, emigration, and travel are not included in the model.<br><br>\n",
    "For this first exercise, we'll be using the values of these paramters from Table 1 in the Gumel et al. paper (displayed below), assuming a population of 4 million and beginning with 1 infected person \\[6\\].<br>\n",
    "<img src = \"Paper_param_table.png\"><br>\n",
    "The parameters were estimated from statistics on a SARS outbreak in the Greater Toronto Area in 2003 \\[6\\]. Take a look at the two vaccine-related parameters, the vaccination coverage rate and vaccine efficacy. The vaccination coverage rate (proportion of susceptible people vaccinated every day) is 1/7. This is an unreasonably large proportion. If 1/7 (approximately 14.3%) of the US population were vaccinated every day, the entire population could be vaccinated in less than a week. In contrast, as of Jan. 4, 2020, the US has administered around 4.23 million total COVID-19 vaccines, which amounts to only about 0.099% of the population \\[7\\]. The table's vaccine efficacy, on the other hand, is more realistic. Vaccine efficacies can vary widely: the flu vaccine can range from 40 - 60% efficacy, while recently-developed COVID-19 vaccines have reached 95% efficacy after two doses \\[8, 9\\]. Therefore, a vaccine efficacy of 0.8, or 80% is not unreasonable. "

    "### Parameter Fitting\n",
    "To fit our parameters, we'll be using data from the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Visual Dashboard by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The US data on cumulative confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases was extracted from the global time series data found [here](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series) \\[3\\]. It is worthwhile to note that recovered cases were estimated from local reports and therefore may not comprise an exact count. There may also be a negligible amount of error in the cumulative deaths data from COVID-19 patients dying of non-COVID-19 related causes. The data provided in this section are from January 22, 2020 to November 28, 2020. If you'd like to download the data files for yourself, the files are provided in the Appendix. <br>\n",

    "We need to look at active case data in order to fit the model. An active case is a person who is currently infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This does not include cases that have already recovered. The data we have is cumulative: it counts the total number of cases since data collection began. We can estimate the active cases by subtracting the cumulative deaths and recovered cases from the cumulative cases:<br>\n",

According to the [National Center of Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-8-508.pdf), there were 3,745,540 births in the US in 2019 \\[11\\]. That's around 10,261 births per day for our births parameter. According to the [Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db355-h.pdf), there were 2,839,205 deaths in the US in 2018 \\[12\\]. That's around 7,778 deaths per day, normalized by the total US population in 2018 of 327.2 million gives us a natural mortality rate constant of approximately 0.00002377. Also according to the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html), the median time of symptom onset following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is 4-5 days, so let's say that it takes 5 days for symptoms to develop and the symptom development rate is 1/5 = 0.2 \\[4\\]. <br><br>\n",
    "Some remaining parameters can be estimated from the data. First, we need to determine which portion of the data to use to make estimations. In general, linear areas are better for estimation. The Active Case graph shows the different waves of the pandemic. The most recent wave of COVID-19, starting around day 289, probably best represents the conditions under which a vaccine would be introduced, so let's look there:"

    "However, for a case where a vaccine is introduced, we need to modify this expression slightly. Instead of using the basic reproduction number, we will use the control reproduction number $R_v$. $R_v$ is similar to $R_0$, but specifically applies when a vaccination program is in place \\[6\\].<br><br>\n",
    "$R_v = \\frac{\\alpha\\beta\\Pi[\\mu+(1-\\tau)\\xi]}{\\mu(\\xi+\\mu)(\\alpha+\\mu)(\\delta+\\mu+d)}$<br><br>\n",
    "However, because we are working with a large population, with a large number of births in the numerator and small parameter values in the denominator, our $R_v$ value is unlikely to fall below 1 even if we meet conditions that would end the pandemic. This is not ideal for conceptualizing the value, but we can still work with it. We just need to use a different value in place of 1. Under our parameters for the US, the threshold that we need to fall under was found to be 425,930,847. Above this $R_v$ value, the number of cases blows up. Below this value, the pandemic ends.<br><br>\n",

Because no vaccinations occur durin the non-burst period, there is time for the overall number of vaccinated people drop as they become infected. <br><br>\n",
    "As with the continuous vaccination method, let's simulate the burst method over a year (approximately). Set both the non-burst interval (days between bursts) and the days per burst to 30, with 6 total bursts. As with continuous vaccination you'll notice that overall cases and deaths will decrease as vaccination coverage rate and vaccine efficacy are increased. Previously, we found that a vaccination coverage rate of 0.0003 coupled with a vaccine efficacy of 0.74 should lead to the end of the pandemic in the US. Set the vaccination coverage rate and vaccine efficacy to these values for both the continuous and burst vaccine models. You'll notice that the continuous model leads to fewer cases and deaths at the end and more vaccinated individuals, compared to the burst model. This makes sense since continuously vaccinating every day offsets the number of vaccinated individuals who later become infected. This is not the case in the burst model, since no vaccinations occur in the non-burst interval, allowing for a decrease in the number of vaccinated individuals as they become infected. In general, continuous vaccination is cheaper because year-round vaccinations mostly consist of people who would need booster doses of vaccinations anyway. The burst model works for seasonal illnesses like the flu or if the normal vaccination coverage for a disease is low but a localized outbreak occurs. <br><br>\n",
